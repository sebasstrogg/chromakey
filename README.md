Fun with Chromakey (Greenscreen)
==

A friend wants to take pictures of people at an event and
have them appear in front of a background (like the Eiffel
Tower or Niagara Falls). So I put together some chromakey
software to do that. It's in PHP so it's not the fastest
thing on earth but it does this example in under a minute
on my Macbook, so it's probably OK for his needs.

All this code is in the public domain.
